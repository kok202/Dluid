## Frame
![frame](../resources/frame.png)
Dluid is composed of frames that are outlined above. 
Material is object which is not block but can be a block. 
And block is the hexagon, which actually becomes a 3D polygon in the Canvas component,
The block also has information about layers used in deep learning. 
Components mean each panel which is designed to read and modify the deep learning layer. 
The term `component` is frequently used in javafx and elsewhere, so be careful not to be confused.
